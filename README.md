## TODO


  * add support for webhooks. regenerate page after code was pushed.
  * add github auth. we can send notification to owner that deps were outdated.
  * add checks for alpha/beta versions, snapshots


## Inspirations

  * https://github.com/xsc/ancient-clj
  * https://github.com/rodnaph/clj-deps
  * https://david-dm.org
  * https://gemnasium.com/


## Ideas

  * amount of downloads last day, week, month
  * new version publish dates
  * commits activity/density
  * number of contributors - basically we want to know if project is actively maintained
  * we want to know how many projects use current one as dependency
  * look into ClojureSphere API  - https://github.com/jkk/clojuresphere
  * receive some notification when new versions are available
  * update some dedicated branch with new versions so they can be tested by continuous integration system for early feedback
